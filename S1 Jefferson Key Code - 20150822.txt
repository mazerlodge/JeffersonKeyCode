Note: 1, 2, 3 in the above are replaced with greek letters delta, phi, theta

If we apply the first numerical key, 33, to the letters we would count 3 over on the first row then identify the next 5 letters, FEETH. The next number, 3, indicates the original position of this letter row. Using 28, you would count 8 more letters over and identify 5 letters that would be placed in the row 2 position.
